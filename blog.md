**03-02-2026** We made major progress with our [Typst template](https://github.com/TUD-JB-OS/typst_template). The cover page has significantly improved.

**02-02-2026** We did a live demo of the starterkit during the official TU Delft kickoff of Open Science funded projects. With a few clicks a new repo was live, demonstrating how easy it is to get started with our tools.

**31-01-2026** A milestone again: we developed a [starterkit](https://github.com/TUD-JB-OS/starterkit). This is a template repository that can be cloned with a few clicks. It then automatically creates a GitHub website and builds two different pdf's from your content with every new submission to your repository. This lowers the technical barrier significantly!

**29-01-2026** We did an official kick-off meeting with the team. Due to illness, holidays and general busy schedules, not everyone could be there, but we had a good start.

**23-12-2025** Our first product has reached a milestone: the [LaTeX template](https://github.com/TUD-JB-OS/latex_template) for thesis has reached a stage where it can be tested! It has been based on the template earlier developed by Luuk Fröling for his [bachelor thesis](https://luukfroling.github.io/BEP/).

**17-11-2025** We have got word that our proposal for the Open Science Fund has been accepted! We will officially start in January but will already start preparing. 

**11-09-2025** We submitted our proposal *Connecting and boosting open science and open education through JB2* to the TU Delft Mainstreaming Open Science Fund.
