# WYSIWYG

We have been working in on a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) editor for content creation. This editor is loaded on the publication page and allows you to change its content in a more visual way - committing changes to GitHub directly to a specific branch, or through a pull request. 

The editor has visual buttons to more easily include formatting, links, images, and other common elements.
