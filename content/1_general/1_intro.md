At Delft University of Technology (TUD), people started using Jupyter Book to create open educational resources mainly in the form of [online textbooks](https://interactivetextbooks.tudelft.nl). Various initiatives were taken to lower the technical barrier for educators to create and share their own resources, see for example [Teachbooks](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl).

With the introduction of Jupyter Book 2, the opportunity arose to create scientific content (e.g., research articles, theses, reports) in addition to educational content. As new technologies are adopted when the benefits are clear and the barriers are low, we applied for the [TUD's Open Science Fund](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/open-science) to explore a seaming effortless workflow with Jupyter Book for open publishing scientific content. 

This guide is the result of this project. We aim to help TUD researchers and educators to create, publish, and share open educational and scientific resources with Jupyter Book. The guide covers the entire workflow from installation, content creation, and customization to publishing and sharing.
