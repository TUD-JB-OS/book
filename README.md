# README


## 📖 Use the manual

For this project we created a manual, a starterkit, and two templates for static output. This manual describes everything you need to know (and more) about writing and publishing a bachelor or master thesis with Jupyter Book, writing and publishing a scientific paper and about writing and publishing educational content with Jupyter Book. 

## 🕵 Where to start 

Already know about Jupyter Book, familiar with GitHub or GitLab, Markdown... start with cloning the starterkit and start writing your own book. New to the ecosystem? Start with the manual, and then move on to the starterkit.

## 🏁 Purpose

The purpose of this project and this manual is to enable others to use Jupyter Book for writing and publishing their own scientific and educational content. We hope to lower the technical barrier for researchers and educators to create and share their own resources, and to promote open science and open education practices.

## 🛠️ Building the Book

You can download and build this manual locally. Install the [required software](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/get-started/install/), [download the repository](https://github.com/TUD-JB-OS/book/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and run the following command in the terminal at the root of the repository (where the myst.yml file is located):

```bash
jupyter-book build
```

This will start a local server and open the book in your web browser.
